# jest-another-RPG

## Description
This application is used to generate a game in the Terminal. The app does not open up onto a front-end browser. This app was created using Node.js and inquirer packages. It was also tested on the back-end using the Jest testing framework.

## Installation
To install the packages needed to display the game in your terminal you will need to download Node from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a>. 

* You will also need to install the Inquirer package from this site:
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer">Inquirer</a>.

* If you'd like to test out the code that is written in the test files then you can install the Jest framework here: <a href="https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started">Jest</a>.



## Instruction
To run the application in the Terminal simply type node app.js into the Terminal and the prompts should appear for you to answer.

You will need to play through the game a few times in order to see each prompt being used.
